# Multi-Webcam Application

Developed a Python-based application using OpenCV to capture and display video feeds from multiple cameras. The program dynamically handles video streams from multiple devices, gracefully substituting a placeholder image when a feed is unavailable. Implemented a robust interface for combining and displaying live camera feeds in a unified window, with real-time video processing capabilities on Linux.

There are files specifically designed for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
